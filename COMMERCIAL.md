# Commercial Licensing

This project is made publicly available under a **non-commercial license** for personal, academic, research, and non-profit use.

Any **commercial use** requires a separate commercial license from the copyright holder.

## What Counts as Commercial Use

Commercial use includes, but is not limited to:

* Use in products or systems that are sold or licensed for a fee
* Integration into commercial hardware or software products
* Use as part of a paid service, SaaS, or subscription offering
* Use in internal commercial R&D for product development
* Use by for-profit entities beyond evaluation or prototyping
* Consulting, contracting, or service delivery based on this software

If you are unsure whether your use is commercial, assume it is and contact me.
